              At Novazync, we believe in giving back to our community. A
              substantial portion of every airdrop’s earnings is shared with
              users based on their activity and tier level. This means that as
              Novazync grows and attracts high-quality projects, users directly
              benefit from increased rewards. The more you engage, the more you
              earn!
